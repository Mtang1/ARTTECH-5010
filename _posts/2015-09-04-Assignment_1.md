1. Make sure everything is complete from _Assignment 0_.
2. Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
3. Watch at least one of these videos [https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos).
2. Extend the in-class light example that we started to include a pedestrian crossing signal that can be initiated by a button.
 	1. During normal operation (if the pedestrian cross button has not been pressed), the traffic light will function as it did in class.
	2. When the pedestrian presses the button, the traffic will not stop immediately, but will complete its cycle and then signal the pedestrian that it is safe to cross (using the two additional LEDs), and then the system will return to its normal traffic light operation.
	3. Before starting, modify the finite state machine diagram.  Identify and draw the additional states, transitions, and inputs associated with the pedestrian signal.
	4. We will be discussing the problem here: http://talk.olab.io/t/assignment-1-traffic-light/897 If you are unable to access that page you need to do two things:
		1. Sign up for http://talk.olab.io.
		2. Send me your username so I can add you to our class group.
