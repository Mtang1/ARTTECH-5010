1. Building off of [this week's examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Week_05).
  - Specifically, take a look at the [Communication](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Week_05/Communication) example for sending data back and forth between Arduino and openFrameworks. 
  - Augment your self-portrait to be controlled by input from the Arduino.
  - Modify your self-portrait to receive Serial data from the Arduino.
  - Create an Arduino application that can send _at least_ one button input and _at least_ one analog value (e.g. a potentiometer) that will modify

2. Key questions you are expected to be able to answer after the project above.
    - Arrays
        - What is the difference between an array and a `std::vector`?
    - Looping
        - What is the difference between a standard `for`-loop and a range-`for` and why might you use one vs. the other?
    - If you are unsure of the answers any of those questions, look it up or check your notes.  If you are still are unclear post a question to the forum and we'll discuss it.

2. Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)

3. (optional) Serial Communication Reading Part 2
    - [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi)
    - [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c)

3. (optional) Supplemental tutorials (for these, you may use Processing or Max/MSP or openFrameworks if you like).
    - [Debounce](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce)
    - [ASCIITable](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ASCIITable)
    - [SerialCallResponse](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SerialCallResponse)
        - Note, you don't need force resistors for this example.  Simple buttons will suffice.
    - [SerialCallResponseASCII](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SerialCallResponseASCII)
        - Note, you don't need force resistors for this example.  Simple buttons will suffice.
    - [SerialEvent](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SerialEvent)
