1. Make sure everything is complete from _Assignment 3_.
    - Review Serial Communication
        - What is "serial" communication?
        - What is "parallel" communication?
        - What does it mean for serial communication to be asynchronous?
            - What is an example?
        - What does it mean for serial communication to be synchronous?
            - What is an example?
        - What does UART mean?
        - What are I2C and SPI and when are they used?
        - What is a "logic level" and what are common voltage values for logic levels?
        - Why do we have to specify the communication speed when using UART-style serial communication?
            - What are bauds?
            - What are data bits?
            - What are parity bits?
            - What are stop bits?
        - What is the difference between these two Arduino expressions?
            - `Serial.println(127);` and `Serial.write(127);`?
            - What are the advantages of using one over the other?
        - What is "ASCII" and why is it used?
    - If you are unsure of the answers any of those questions, look it up or check your notes.  If you are still are unclear post a question to the forum and we'll discuss it.

3. Using all that we have learned about the Arduino thus far, create your own project based upon your interests. This project is not required to use _everything_ we have covered but should demonstrate an attempt on your part to design a circuit and required code to create the effect that you want. This is _not_ meant to be a fully refined artistic concept (though you are welcome to give it as much polish as you would like!). It _is_ intended as an opportunity for you to apply and integrate what we have been working on in a way that makes sense for your practice. Think of it as a technological "study" for a future (or current) project.  Next week you are required to come with some significant progress completed. If you want to explore technologies that we have not yet covered in class (e.g. motors, sensors etc) next week will be an opportunity to work on some of those more specialized topics during class.  The following week, you will give a very brief (5-minute) review of your project, with special attention paid to the "new" techniques, technologies, and code that you discovered.
